<h1>File Finder Project</h1>
<p>This is a project that I began and finished after my first year of learning Java at my high school.</p>
<p>When I moved to college I got a new laptop and lost the original project, so ever since ive been trying to recreate
    it.</p>

<p>the above photo shows it in run time</p>
<p>current issues are the Ui design and opening files</p>
<p>when running it you can navigate though all the files easy minus the back and forward buttons</p>
<p>features this finder comes with is recognising is folders are empty or have files in them. in most runtime
    environments the search is faster.</p>
